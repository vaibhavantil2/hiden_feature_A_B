                                First off, you're free to host Flagsmith yourself, free of charge. We're open source,
                                and totally fine with you doing that.

                                The only metric you need to count when deciding on your plan is the number of Monthly
                                Active Users you need to serve flags for (see below).
                                You can create as many projects, flags, admin users as you like. We feel that this is
                                the fairest measure of usage.

                                This is simply the total number of API requests you make for each calendar month, across
                                all the projects in your organisation.

                                Each time you instantiate one of our client SDKs and get the flags for a user or
                                application, you make 1 request.
                                For example, if you have a single page React web application, you would generally make 1
                                API request when the user loads your app, and then
                                maintain that data for the duration of the user session. If your web pages were
                                generated server-side, you would generally make 1 API request
                                for each page view.
