            <p>
By using the BulletTrain.io website ("service"), or any services of Bullet Train Ltd, you are

                agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to
                bind such entity, its affiliates and all users who access our services through your account to these

            <h5>Who Are We?</h5>
            <p>
Bullet Train is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform provider that serves companies looking to
                implement feature flags in their overall software development lifecycle. Feature flags allow software
                developers to change application behavior from outside of the application without redeploying their
                code. This has a number of benefits including a separation of risks, ability to deliver different
                experiences in a targeted manner, and the lower administrative burden of software release. Bullet Train
                provides a turnkey robust feature management solution that offers high availability, scalability, and
                audit control.
            </p>

            <p>
Because Bullet Train customers themselves have customers, language can get very confusing. In this
                document, we refer to our customers (Companies who utilize our platform in their software) as members
                (team members). We refer to the customers of those members to be "users" or "end-users". When the
                generic pronoun "you" is used, it is meant to refer to anyone reading this policy and can generically
                mean anyone who interacts with our website, a member of our services, or a user of one of our
                members.
            </p>

            <p>
This policy largely deals with members, how we keep their data safe, and how we are allowed to use their
                data. If you are an end-user of one of our member's services, then you should consult their privacy
                policy instead, as the member policy applies to the information collected instead of this policy. Bullet
                Train collects data from our members about their user under their direction, but we do not have a direct
                relationship with users themselves. This policy applies to the data as long as we retain the data.
            </p>

            <p>
This policy does not cover third party websites, products, or services even if they link to our
                servicesâ€”you should consider their own privacy policies carefully. If you disagree with the practices
                described in this policy, then you should (a) take necessary steps to remove cookies from your computer
                after leaving our website, and (b) discontinue your use of our services.
            </p>

            <h5>How Do We Use Data?</h5>
            <p>
The data we collect depends on how our services are used. We receive some data directly, like when you
                visit one of our web properties, sign up for a trial, or send us email. Other times, we get data
                indirectly, like when we record that you visited one of our websites using technologies like cookies. We
                also get data from third parties, like from our members when they pass data to us to process.
            </p>

            <p>
The collection and use of data is essential to the value that we provide as a service, as well as improve
                on the services we provide; but we aim to do our best to keep data safe and secure.

                        through our platform. Our members have a responsibility to understand the data they send to us

            <h5>Right to Access, View, or Remove Your Information</h5>
            <p>
You have a right to access the personal information we hold about you. Whenever you use our site or
                Bullet Train Services, we strive to make sure that your Personal Information is correct. If that
                information is wrong, we give you tools and methods to update it quickly or delete it, unless that
                information is necessary for legal or business purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may
                ask you to verify your identity before making changes. We may reject requests that are unreasonably
                repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing new systems or
                fundamentally changing our existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely
                impractical (e.g. requests concerning information on our backup systems). Because we protect information
                from accidental or malicious destruction, after data is removed from our servers, it can take some time
                for that data to be purged.
            </p>
            <p>
To request removal of your Personal Information from our site or services, contact us at
                privacy@bullettrain.io. Bullet Train cares deeply about the sanctity of your data and our privacy team
                will manage each request on a case by case basis.
            </p>
            <p>
We totally understand your right to have us stop contacting you. We endeavor to give you the ability to
                control the way we contact you. You may use the the links at the bottom of each communication to opt-out
                of further communications.

If you are a user of one of our member's services and need to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data
                about you, please contact the memberâ€”in this case, they are the data controllers. We will comply with
                the wishes of our members should they direct us to take action about the modification/removal of
                collected data.

            <h5>Jurisdiction</h5>
            <p>
Our services are global and Data (of all classifications) may be stored and processed anywhere where we
                or one of our service providers has services. We may transfer data to countries outside of your country
                of residence, which may have different rules applicable to your data. Bullet Train will take measures to
                ensure that any transfers comply with applicable laws and your data remains protected as per this
                policy.
